For my submission, question 3, the augmented matrix shows that there is a -5 when it should be a -4. This was a typo when converting to from hard copy to word. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81469270/132785599-3bd281c4-7c62-4de1-bd1a-c11313137d85.png)
However, if you replace the -5 with -4 the calculation will still work.
